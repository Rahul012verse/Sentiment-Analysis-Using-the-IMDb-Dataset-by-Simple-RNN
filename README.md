# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-the-IMDb-Dataset-by-Simple-RNN
IMDb dataset is used for model-building to analyze the sentiments of reviewers and netizens. Algorithms like Simple RNN; consisting of a Word Embedding layer and a Dense layer; is used to classify the text-input reviews. Three types of classifications are basically made namely; 1. If prediction score is less than 35%, then model predicts a negative review, 2. If prediction score is between 35% to 65%, then model predicts a mixed one; 3. If prediction score is greater than 65%, then model predicts a positive review.
