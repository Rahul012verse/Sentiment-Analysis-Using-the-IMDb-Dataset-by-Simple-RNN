THE IMDB DATASET:-

The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) dataset is a widely used dataset in natural language processing (NLP) 
 for binary sentiment classification, particularly with TensorFlow and Keras. 
It consists of 50,000 highly polarized movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database, 
 with 25,000 reviews designated for training and 25,000 for testing. 
Each review is labeled as either positive (1) or negative (0) sentiment.Â 
Each review is a sequence of words, which can be represented as integers using word indices.
